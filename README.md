## Problem statement
The project focuses on generating plausible masks for brain pathology. The main goal is to develop a model that, given a healthy brain MRI scan, generates a mask indicating the plausible shape and size of where a specific pathology could theoretically occur in the scan. These masks will then be used to generate pathologies within healthy brain scans, thereby augmenting the dataset for training pathology segmentation models. The project aims to compare different mask generation strategies based on the segmentation scores of models trained on the augmented dataset. The technique can help make segmentation models more accurate, thus aiding in the automation of pathology detection.

## Methods && Results 
## Proposed methods 1
Our idea was consist at three main points(figure 3):
1. Train 3D segmentation model on patches with lesion mask in the center;

2. Given a patch of healthy MRI the model will generate a mask in the center analogous to seen on the train;

3. Additional conditioning on grey/white matter maps can be done.

Further work consisted in the fact that the generated masks were used to create synthetic pathologies on MRI of healthy people using the I2SB imaging model. After that, the segmentation model was trained on real and synthetic data, Dice and coverage indicators were measured. But the metrics showed that the generated mask performed worse than simple sphere masks(figure 4).Masks generated with 3DUnet with grey/white matter mask performed better than the one without conditioning.

## Proposed methods 2

To further enhance the quality of pathology mask generation, we propose training a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (figure 5) where the discriminator takes the masked brain images as input. This approach helps to avoid the issue of differences between healthy and pathological MRI scans. The generator will be trained to create plausible pathology masks, while the discriminator will distinguish between generated and real masks based on the masked brain images. By having the discriminator focus solely on the masked brain areas, the model can concentrate on the pathological regions, disregarding variations in healthy tissue, thereby reducing the likelihood of generating false pathologies.
